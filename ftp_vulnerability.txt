Vulnerability: FTP Users Not Properly Chrooted

Description:
The vsftpd server is currently configured without enforcing chroot for local users. 
This means users can potentially navigate outside their home directories and access 
other parts of the file system.

Risk Assessment:
- Severity: Medium
- CVSS Score: 6.0

Potential Impact:
1. FTP users can access files outside their intended directories
2. Sensitive system files could be exposed
3. Privacy between different FTP users is not guaranteed
4. Potential for information disclosure or unauthorized access

Detection Method:
Examination of vsftpd configuration showed chroot_local_user is not properly enabled.
The configuration file contains comments about chroot_local_user but it is not actively enforced.

Remediation Actions:
1. Created a backup of the original configuration
2. Enabled chroot_local_user in vsftpd configuration
3. Set allow_writeable_chroot=NO for added security
4. Restarted the vsftpd service to apply changes

Verification:
1. Confirmed that chroot_local_user is now enabled
2. Verified the FTP service is still running properly

Security Improvement:
The FTP service now properly restricts users to their home directories, preventing:
- Directory traversal outside intended boundaries
- Access to sensitive system files
- Unauthorized access to other users' files
- Information disclosure vulnerabilities
