## Security Recommendations to Prevent Future Attacks

### SSH Hardening Recommendations
- Enforce key-based authentication only and disable password authentication
- Disable direct root login via SSH
- Implement fail2ban to protect against brute force attempts
- Consider changing the default SSH port to reduce automated scanning
- Regular audit of authorized_keys files and SSH access logs

### Web Server Security Recommendations
- Disable directory listing in Apache configuration
- Use .htaccess files to control access to sensitive directories
- Keep web server software updated with security patches
- Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Regular scanning of web applications for vulnerabilities

### WordPress Security Recommendations
- Maintain proper file permissions (600 for wp-config.php)
- Keep WordPress core, themes, and plugins updated
- Implement WordPress security plugins (Wordfence, Sucuri)
- Use strong, unique admin passwords
- Consider implementing two-factor authentication

### System Security Recommendations
- Implement a regular patching schedule for all software
- Deploy host-based intrusion detection systems
- Configure centralized logging and log analysis
- Implement network segmentation to limit lateral movement
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all user accounts

### Monitoring and Response Recommendations
- Implement real-time security monitoring
- Develop incident response procedures
- Conduct regular security assessments and penetration tests
- Establish a security baseline and monitor for deviations
- Create a security incident response team
