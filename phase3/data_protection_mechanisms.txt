# Data Protection Mechanisms

## 1. Backup Strategy

### 1.1 Backup Procedures
- Daily incremental backups of critical data
- Weekly full backups of all systems
- Monthly backups stored offsite
- Quarterly backup verification and testing
- Annual disaster recovery simulation

### 1.2 Backup Technologies
- Automated backup software for scheduled backups
- Encryption of backup data in transit and at rest
- Redundant storage solutions for backup data
- Version control for critical configuration files
- Immutable backup solutions for ransomware protection

### 1.3 Backup Verification
- Regular test restores to verify backup integrity
- Automated verification of backup completion
- Documentation of backup success/failure
- Periodic full system restore testing
- Validation of application functionality after restore

## 2. Encryption Implementation

### 2.1 Data at Rest Encryption
- Full disk encryption for all endpoints and servers
- Transparent database encryption for sensitive data
- Encrypted file systems for critical data storage
- Encryption of backup media
- Secure key management procedures

### 2.2 Data in Transit Encryption
- TLS/SSL for all web applications
- Secure VPN for remote access
- SFTP instead of FTP for file transfers
- Encrypted email for sensitive communications
- Secure API connections with mutual authentication

### 2.3 Key Management
- Hardware security modules for critical keys
- Key rotation schedules
- Separation of duties for key management
- Secure key storage solutions
- Emergency key recovery procedures
- Audit logging of key usage

## 3. Access Control Implementation

### 3.1 Authentication Mechanisms
- Multi-factor authentication for critical systems
- Strong password policies
- Single sign-on (SSO) with appropriate controls
- Biometric authentication where appropriate
- Certificate-based authentication for systems
- Regular credential rotation

### 3.2 Authorization Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Just-in-time access provisioning
- Regular access reviews and certification
- Automated deprovisioning of access
- Segregation of duties for critical functions

### 3.3 Access Monitoring and Audit
- Centralized logging of authentication events
- Alerts for unusual access patterns
- Regular review of access logs
- User activity monitoring for privileged accounts
- Failed login attempt monitoring and alerting
- Session timeout policies
