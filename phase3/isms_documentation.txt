Organization: 4Geeks Academy  
Author: Theresa Baker

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the organization's Information Security Management System (ISMS) implemented in accordance with ISO 27001 standards. The ISMS provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive information, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability through appropriate risk management processes.

## 1. Introduction and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose of the ISMS

The ISMS is designed to:
- Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
- Establish a structured approach to information security
- Implement risk-based security controls
- Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
- Provide a framework for continuous improvement

### 1.2 Scope Statement

This ISMS covers:
- All information systems and data owned or managed by the organization
- All internal processes and business functions
- All personnel, including employees, contractors, and temporary staff
- All physical locations and environments supporting information systems
- All interfaces with external systems and third-party services

## 2. Risk Assessment Methodology

### 2.1 Risk Assessment Process

The risk assessment follows a structured 5-step approach:

1. **Asset Identification and Valuation**
   - Inventory of information assets
   - Asset categorization (information, software, physical, services, people)
   - Asset valuation criteria (confidentiality, integrity, availability impact)

2. **Threat Assessment**
   - Identification of potential threats to assets
   - Categorization of threats (external, internal, environmental)
   - Assessment of threat likelihood

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Identification of vulnerabilities in assets
   - Assessment of vulnerability severity
   - Correlation of vulnerabilities with threats

4. **Risk Calculation**
   - Risk = Impact × Likelihood
   - Risk levels defined as:
     - High: Score 15-25
     - Medium: Score 8-14
     - Low: Score 1-7

5. **Risk Treatment Planning**
   - Risk mitigation (implementing controls)
   - Risk avoidance (eliminating risk source)
   - Risk transfer (sharing risk with third parties)
   - Risk acceptance (acknowledging and accepting risk)

### 2.2 Risk Assessment Matrix

| Likelihood ↓ Impact → | Minimal (1) | Minor (2) | Moderate (3) | Major (4) | Severe (5) |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **Almost Certain (5)** | 5 (M) | 10 (M) | 15 (H) | 20 (H) | 25 (H) |
| **Likely (4)** | 4 (L) | 8 (M) | 12 (M) | 16 (H) | 20 (H) |
| **Possible (3)** | 3 (L) | 6 (M) | 9 (M) | 12 (M) | 15 (H) |
| **Unlikely (2)** | 2 (L) | 4 (L) | 6 (M) | 8 (M) | 10 (M) |
| **Rare (1)** | 1 (L) | 2 (L) | 3 (L) | 4 (L) | 5 (M) |
