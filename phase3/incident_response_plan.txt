# Incident Response Plan Based on NIST SP 800-61

## 1. Preparation Phase

### 1.1 Incident Response Team Structure
- IR Coordinator: Oversees the entire incident response process
- Technical Lead: Manages forensic investigation and remediation
- Communications Officer: Handles stakeholder communications
- Legal Advisor: Ensures compliance with regulations
- Documentation Specialist: Maintains incident documentation

### 1.2 Required Resources
- Forensic workstations with analysis tools
- Network traffic capture equipment
- Digital evidence preservation tools
- Secure communication channels
- Contact information for all stakeholders

### 1.3 Documentation Templates
- Incident reporting forms
- Chain of custody documentation
- Investigation checklists
- Communication templates
- Post-incident review forms

## 2. Detection and Analysis Phase

### 2.1 Detection Mechanisms
- Security monitoring tools (IDS/IPS, SIEM)
- Log analysis systems
- File integrity monitoring
- User behavior analytics
- Vulnerability scanners

### 2.2 Analysis Procedures
- Establish a timeline of events
- Identify affected systems and scope
- Determine attack vectors
- Assess impact on critical assets
- Preserve evidence using forensic methods

### 2.3 Incident Categorization
- Category 1 (Critical): System breach with data exfiltration
- Category 2 (High): Active intrusion attempt
- Category 3 (Medium): Potential security weakness
- Category 4 (Low): Policy violation

## 3. Containment Phase

### 3.1 Short-term Containment
- Isolate affected systems from the network
- Block malicious IP addresses at firewall
- Disable compromised user accounts
- Stop affected services temporarily
- Preserve forensic evidence

### 3.2 Long-term Containment
- Apply emergency security patches
- Implement additional access controls
- Enhance monitoring for similar attacks
- Deploy additional detection mechanisms
- Create system backups before remediation

### 3.3 Containment Strategy Selection
- Consider operational impact of containment
- Assess potential evidence destruction
- Evaluate service availability requirements
- Determine containment effectiveness
- Document containment decisions

## 4. Eradication Phase

### 4.1 Root Cause Identification
- Analyze attack vectors and methods
- Identify exploited vulnerabilities
- Determine initial access point
- Map lateral movement within network
- Document all compromised systems

### 4.2 Malware and Backdoor Removal
- Scan systems with updated security tools
- Remove unauthorized accounts and access
- Eliminate persistence mechanisms
- Verify integrity of system files
- Document all removed components

### 4.3 Vulnerability Remediation
- Apply security patches and updates
- Correct misconfigurations
- Update security policies
- Implement additional security controls
- Document all remediation actions

## 5. Recovery Phase

### 5.1 System Restoration
- Validate system integrity before restoration
- Restore from clean backups if necessary
- Rebuild systems from trusted media
- Reset all credentials
- Document restoration procedures

### 5.2 Security Validation
- Conduct vulnerability scanning
- Perform penetration testing
- Verify security controls are functioning
- Monitor for signs of persistent threats
- Document validation results

### 5.3 Return to Operation
- Implement phased return to production
- Monitor systems for abnormal activity
- Validate business process functionality
- Adjust security controls as needed
- Document return to operation steps

## 6. Post-Incident Activity

### 6.1 Lessons Learned
- Conduct post-incident review meeting
- Document incident timeline and response
- Identify response gaps and challenges
- Collect feedback from response team
- Document findings and recommendations

### 6.2 Improvement Implementation
- Update incident response procedures
- Enhance detection mechanisms
- Implement additional preventive controls
- Provide additional training as needed
- Document implemented improvements

### 6.3 Metrics and Reporting
- Time to detect incident
- Time to contain incident
- Time to eradicate threats
- Time to recover systems
- Cost of incident and response
